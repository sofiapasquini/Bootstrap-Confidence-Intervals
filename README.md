# Hockey-Player-Performance-Quantification
I used the bootstrap method to compute confidence intervals in order to explore the relationship between the physiology of hockey players and their overall performance scores.

I use a data set "hockey_draftees_2005.csv" in order to make predictions as well as a set "hockey_draftees_text.csv" in order to test the model performance out-of-sample. I explore the use of a quadratic model to relate the weight of a hockey player to their overall performance score.
